девочка-огонь, но на душе морозы

The Man’ Lyrics Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool

They’d say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to 

And that would be ok

For me to do

Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 

I’d be a fearless leader
I’d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What’s that like? 

I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man

And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...

Then I’d be the man 

I’d be the man x 4 times

They’d say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 

What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play

I’d be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez 

I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man

And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...

Then I’d be the man 

I’d be the man x 4 times

What’s it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 

And it’s all good if you’re bad 
And it’s okay if you’re mad 
If I was out ﬂashing my dollars 
I’d be a bitch, not a baller 

They paint me out to be bad 
So it’s okay that I’m mad 

I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man

I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 

I’d be the man

I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man

And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 

I’d be the man x 5 times

If I was a man

I’d be the man
